Media Crawler
=============

A tool for crawling, indexing of media files coming with a powerful search engine.
Actually only FTP servers are supported.

It depends on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and [Redis](http://redis.io/).


How it works
------------

1. Downloading the filelist with `lftp -e 'du -a'`.
2. Parsing the filelist and inserting paths with media extensions into the MongoDB database.
3. Downloading a chunk (first 50 kb) for each path.
4. Analyzing each chunk with `ffmpeg -i $file` and copying the metadata into the ElasticSearch index.


Installation
------------

It is recommended to install Ruby 2.1 using [RVM](http://rvm.io/):

    (sudo) curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

On Debian/Ubuntu you also need to install the following packages:

    (sudo) apt-get install mongodb redis-server avconv lftp

Elasticsearch:

    wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.4.2.deb
    (sudo) dpkg -i elasticsearch-1.4.2.deb

Clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/digineo/media_crawler.git

Now change into the directory and install the required gems:

    cd media_crawler
    gem install bundler
    bundle install


Running
-------

Start the rails process with:

    rails s

Now you can reach the media crawler under [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Start [Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/) for background processing:

    sidekiq -v


Managing servers
----------------

Actually it is only possible to manage servers using the rails shell. You can enter the rails shell by executing `rails c` and leave it by typing `exit` and pressing return.

### Adding servers

    Server.create! :name => 'my local computer', :uri_ftp => '127.0.0.1'

There are some methods in the `app/models/server.rb` to crawl and index your server.
To update the file list of Server #1 execute:

    Server.find(1).update_files

To download and parse alle metadata of Server #1 execute:

    Server.find(1).update_metadata

### Crawling and indexing

Just take a look at the maintenance methods in `app/models/maintenance.rb'. To crawl an index all servers execute:

    Maintenance.update_all
